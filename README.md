## Rotary Encoder Library
This library enables (optical) distance / trigger sensors like the HW-201 to function as a rotary wheel encoder. It can be used to count rotations and rotation steps of wheels / etc. These rotations can then be used eg. to determine the driven distance of a robot.

### Features
- Count wheel steps
- Count full wheel rotations
- Get difference in wheel steps since last lookup (delta)
- Sensor smooting / debouncing
